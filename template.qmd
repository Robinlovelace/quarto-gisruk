# Introduction to guidelines {#sec-introduction}

The purpose of providing this template is to standardise the format of the abstracts submitted to GISRUK 2023. These notes are based on author guidelines previously produced for the GISRUK conference series which in turn were based on other guidelines.

The pages should have margins of 2.5 cm all round. The base font should be Times New Roman 11pt, or closest equivalent and text should be single spaced. Each section of the paper should be numbered. Section headings should be left-justified and given in bold type.  The title should be 16pt and the authors 14pt. The first line of each paragraph in each section should NOT be indented.

##  Sub-sections {#sec-subsections}

Sub-sections should also be numbered as shown here. The sub-section heading should be left-justified and given in bold type (11pt). 

# Figures, Tables and Equations {#sec-fig-tab-eq}

Tables should be as below (or as close as possible) and should be referenced as Table 1 in the text.

Equations should be centred on the page and numbered consecutively in the right-hand margin, as below. They should be referred to in the text as Equation 1.
